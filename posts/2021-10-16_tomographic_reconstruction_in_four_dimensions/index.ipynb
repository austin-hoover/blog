This method is accurate but slow and not available for our beam ($10^{14}$ protons moving at 90% the speed of light).

    "Tomographic reconstruction is used in a wide variety of fields, particularly in medical imaging where X-rays are used to generate 1D projections of a 2D slice of organic material at various angles. The same idea can be applied to a phase space distribution. Consider $f(x, x')$. It's straightforward to measure a 1D projection along the $x$ axis by sweeping a vertical conducting wire across the beam path; the problem is that this only corresponds to one projection angle. The trick is to approximate motion in an accelerator as a series of linear transformations of the phase space coordinates: shearing, scaling, and rotation. Thus, the projection of a beam at one location onto the $x$ axis is a scaled projection of a projection onto a rotated axis at a different location. The projection angle can be controlled by varying the electromagnetic fields between the two locations."

    "It's more challenging to find $f(x, x', y, y')$. It's simple to reconstruct the $4 \\times 4$ covariance matrix from 1D projections; I've implemented this method in the SNS and won't discuss it here. To obtain the 4D *distribution*, we generally need at least 2D projections. I'm interested in this approach because the final destination of the SNS beam — the target — is coated with a luminescent material which gives the 2D projection onto the $x$-$y$ plane. The idea that I'll begin to explore in this post is whether these 2D projections can be used to reconstruct the 4D phase space distribution. I'll first go over the common reconstruction algorithms in 2D and mention if they could be extended to 4D."

    "I've mentioned that at least three methods (ART, MENT, grid-based) will generalize to 4D reconstruction from 2D projections. But what I'd like to look at now is a different, hopefully easier method described in Hock (2013). The method uses 2D projections but only uses 2D reconstruction methods like those described in this post. It's sort of like a CT scan: 1D projections are used to reconstruct a 2D slice of a human body, and then the slice is moved along the body to reconstruct the 3D image. This would be nice because the conditions for a good 2D reconstruction are well-understood, but might not be clear for higher-dimensional versions of the algorithms."

    "I've assumed that the transfer matrices connecting the coordinates are simple rotation matrices. Although that isn't true in reality, there is a trick we can play. Any transfer matrix $M$ can be writen as the product $M = V R V^{-1}$, where $V$ provides shearing + scaling and $R$ is a rotation by the phase advances $\\mu_x$ and $\\mu_y$. Applying $V^{-1}$ to the coordinates is called *normalizing* the coordinates. What we can do is normalize (scale) the measured profiles, perform the reconstruction in normalized phase space, then unnormalize the reconstructed distribution. \n",

    "In normalized phase space, the transfer matrices are just rotation matrices ($R$) and the projection angles are the phase advances. This is an advantage because the phase advances are easier to control than the true projection angles. Also, the reconstructed $x$-$x'$ and $y$-$y'$ projections will be somewhat circular in this space, which should reduce errors.\n",

    "The (un)normalization steps will involve interpolation since we're performing a transformation on an image, and I'm not yet sure how this will affect the reconstruction error. Anyhow, we don't *have* to reconstruct in normalized phase space if this turns out to be an issue."

    "So, the question is whether we can independently vary the $x$ and $y$ phase advances at the target, and if so, by how much. There are five independent quadrupoles before the target — three focusing and two defocusing — QH26, QV27, QH28, QV29 and QH30. Before that, there are eight quadrupoles — four focusing and four defocusing — that share two powers supplies. One power supply controls QH18, QH20, QH22, and QH24, and another controls QV19, QV21, QV23, and QV25. "

    "There are also a constraints. First, the beam size far away from the target should remain small. We measure the beam size using the $\\beta$ function, which should remain below 35 [m/rad]. The beam becomes much larger close to the target; there, the $\\beta$ function should remain below 100 [m/rad]. Finally, the SNS target has tight constraints on the beam size and the beam density. It's safest to keep the $\\beta$ functions within 10 or 20 percent of the design value.  "

    "Initial tests of Hock's 4D reconstruction method are promising. There are a number of things to investigate. Ideally, the minimum number of projections is used. First, I should play with the number of projections using ART to see how the reconstruction error scales. I would also like to implement MENT, which should do better with fewer projections. I should then test the \"direct\" 4D reconstruction methods such as ART, MENT, or grid-based and compare them to Hock's method. I should also investigate how the methods respond to noise, changes in the grid size, and more complex distributions.\n",

    "The script to perform the data collection for this method is pretty simple: compute the correct optics, update the live magnet strengths accordingly, send a beam to the target, and save the target image. The biggest issue is execution time. In our next study at the SNS, we'll have plenty of time to run the script in addition to our other tasks. Hopefully this will be a helpful diagnostic."
