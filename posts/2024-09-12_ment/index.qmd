Maximum entropy tomography is a 

Maximizing entropy is difficult because it is a constrained optimization of a nonlinear functional of the distribution. For a variable $x \in \mathbb{R}^N$, we must maximize the entropy functional,

\begin{equation}
S[\rho(x), \rho_*(x)] = -\int \rho(x) \log \left( \frac{\rho(x)}{\rho_*(x)} \right) dx,
\end{equation}

where the integral is over the domain of $x$, while satisfying a set of constraints,

\begin{align}
G_1[\rho(x)] &= 0 \\
G_2[\rho(x)] &= 0 \\
\vdots & \\
G_K[\rho(x)] &= 0 \\
\end{align}

[This paper]() describes a method to approximate the maximum-entropy solution when
