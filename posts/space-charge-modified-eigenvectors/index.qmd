In our [eigenpainting experiment](../2026-01-30_eigenpainting-prl) at the SNS, we measured final intrinsic emittance $\varepsilon_1 = 12.4$ and $\varepsilon_2 = 5.1$ (mm mrad), giving a ratio $\varepsilon_1 / \varepsilon_2 = 2.4$. The beam intensity in the experiment was $I = I_0 = 600$ minipulses, with each minipulse containing around $1.5 \times 10^{14}$ protons within an emittance $\varepsilon_1 = \varepsilon_2 \approx 0.25$ [mm mrad]. Here are the simulated beam distributions and emittances as the intensity increases:

The simulation without space charge predicts $\varepsilon_1 = 4.2$ and $\varepsilon_2 = 0.25$, or a ratio of 16. So there there was a large growth of the four-dimensional emittance $\varepsilon_{4D} = \varepsilon_1 \varepsilon_2$ in our experiment.

I mentioned that we didn't consider the effect of space charge on the eigenvectors. The linear component of the space charge force modifies the transfer matrix $\mathbf{M}$ to an effective transfer matrix $\hat{\mathbf{M}}$. Tracking a particle through the linear lattice + linear space charge kicks is the same as just applying $\hat{\mathbf{M}}$ to the initial coordinates. For a special set of initial beam parameters, $\hat{\mathbf{M}}$ represents a periodic focusing system. This occurs when $\mathbf{\Sigma} = \hat{\mathbf{M}} \mathbf{\Sigma} \hat{\mathbf{M}}^T$, where $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ is the beam covariance matrix. We want to paint along an eigenvector of $\hat{\mathbf{M}}$, not $\mathbf{M}$.

I calculated the matched covariance matrix ("envelope") for beam intensity ranging from 0 to 200 minipulses.
