title: "Space-charge-modified eigenvectors for improved eigenpainting"
draft: true

In @holmes_2018_injection, [Jeff Holmes](https://web.ornl.gov/~holmesja1/JHolmes/interests.html) ran simulations of the proposed method in the SNS ring.^[it wasn't labeled ask *eigenpainting* at that point. We made the explicit connection to eigenvectors later.]
