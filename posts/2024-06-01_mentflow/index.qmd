This post discusses the preprint *High-dimensional phase space tomography using normalizing flows* [[arxiv]()]. Phase space tomography is a technique to reconstruction a position-momentum distribution from low-dimensional projections. Entropy maximization is a mathematically rigorous way to incorporate prior information in the reconstruction, providing strong regularization when measurements are sparse. Entropy maximization is difficult to implement when the phase space is high-dimensional. In this paper, we explored the use of generative models, specifically *normalizing flows*, for maximum-entropy phase space tomograpy.


## Indirectly measuring position-momentum distributions

To model the behavior of a charged particle beam, we need to know how its particles are distributed in position-momentum space, or *phase space*. There are six phase space variables: three position coordinates ($x$, $y$, $z$) and three momentum coordinates ($x'$, $y'$, $z'$), which we wrap into a single vector $\mathbf{x} = [x, x', y, y', z, z']^T$. Since we can't measure individual particles, we describe the beam using a probability density function $\rho(\mathbf{x})$, where 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:norm}\tag{1}
    \int \rho(\mathbf{x}) d\mathbf{x} = 1.
\end{equation}

Measuring the phase space distribution is a major focus in accelerator physics. In a [previous post](../2023-05-28_btf), I described our efforts to measure the distribution directly. Here, I'll describe efforts to reconstruct the distribution from partial information. I'll assume we can only measure projections of the distribution onto position space. For example, we can measure the 1D distribution $\rho(x)$ by sweeping a conducting wire across the beam and measuring the secondary electrons emitted from the wire at each position. Note that the 1D distribution $\rho(x)$ is really an integral over the hidden momentum coordinates:
\begin{equation}\tag{1}
    \rho(x) = \int \rho(x, x') dx'.
\end{equation}
If we could rotate the phase space distribution, we would obtain 1D projections along different angles in phase space. This is the same problem faced in medical CT, where the detector rotates instead of the distribution. Thus, if we could rotate the phase space distribution, we could apply standard CT algorithms to reconstruct the phase space distribution.

Imagine the beam was placed in a harmonic potential well. A beautiful insight from classical mechanics is that, while particles perform sinusoidal oscillations in position space, they trace a circle in phase space! Thus, measuring $\rho(x)$ at different times would be equivalent to measuring the projection of $\rho(x, x')$ along different angles in phase space. The electromagnetic focusing fields in an accelerator *do not* create a simple harmonic potential. But after some approximations, we can often decouple the motion in the three planes and write
\begin{equation}
    \begin{bmatrix}
      x(t) \\ x'(t)
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \mathbf{M}
    \begin{bmatrix}
      x(0) \\ x'(0)
    \end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{M}$ is a linear transfer matrix. We can account for the shearing and scaling so that our measurements still amount to projections along different angles in phase space. We can measure the beam at different times by placing wirescanners at different positions along the accelerator lattice. Or we could meaure the beam at one position and vary the upstream optics; both methods update the transfer matrix. Thus, by measuring the spatial density at different locations along the accelerator lattice, or under different focusing optics, we can use any CT algorithm to reconstruct the phase space distribution at any point upstream of the measurements.

The problem becomes *much* more difficult when we consider 6D phase space tomograpy from arbitrary nonlinear phase space transformations. We have to search the space of 6D distribution functions. In 2D, we can course-grain the distribution and search the space of images, but this does not scale well to 6D. A $50 \times 50 \times 50 \times 50 \times 50 \times 50$ grid already has 15 billion cells! The storage requirements for many conventional tomography algorithms are even worse because they have to store a matrix connecting the distribution to its projections. For this reason, even 4D tomography rules out the use of most conventional algorithms.


## Entropy maximization for inverse problems

Another issue is that accelerators restrict the number and quality of measured projections. In medical CT, reconstructions proceed from hundreds of measurements at optimally chosen projection angles. In accelerators, we may be limited to tens of measurements, even as few as three or four in some cases. Furthermore, the measurements may not be optimal. In medical CT, we know that we should space the projection angles evenly over 180 degrees. This is usually not possible in 2D phase space tomography, and in 4D or 6D tomography, we don't even know how to determine the best transformations. 

All this to say: phase space tomography can be severely ill-posed. There can be many distributions consistent with the same data. This problem is already important in 2D, but becomes exponentially worse in 4D and 6D. How should we proceed if we must select a single distribution from the feasible set? Our strategy will be to maximize a functional $H[\rho(\mathbf{x})]$, subject to the measurement constraints. There might not be a general functional that applies in all situations, but if there is such a functional, it should give correct results in simple cases. It turns out that we only need to require four things:
1. The maximum of $H$ should be unique.
2. The maximum of $H$ should not depend on the choice of coordinates.
3. We should be able to update $\rho(\mathbf{x})$ in domain $D$ without affecting $\rho(\mathbf{x})$ in regions outside $D$.
4. If we have information the [...]

We end up with the relative entropy:
\begin{equation}
    H[\rho(\mathbf{x}, \rho_*(\mathbf{x})] = 
    -\int \rho(\mathbf{x}) \log\left(\frac{\rho(\mathbf{x})}{\rho_*(\mathbf{x})}\right)
\end{equation}
Here, $\rho_*(\mathbf{x}) is a *prior* enoding our knowledge before seeing any data. The relative entropy has a maximum at zero, when $\rho(\mathbf{x}) = \rho_*(\mathbf{x})$, so if there is no data, entropy maximization (ME) returns the prior. ME tells us what *not* to do: it tells us not to change our minds unless *forced* by the data.

ME is an extremely general principle of inference, not confined to tomograpy or statistical physics or any specific problem. It sits on a firm mathematical foundation. The only arguments *against* ME are the following:
1. If we have enough data, all algorithms give the same answer.
2. It's too hard to maximize the entropy.
I've argued above that particle accelerator measurements often do not tightly constrain the phase space distribution. That leaves the second consideration. Indeed, maximizing the entropy is challenging, as the entropy is a highly nonlinear function of the probability density.

### MENT

Let's define our problem. Let $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ be the phase space coordinates. On each measurement, we transform the phsae space coordinates via a symplectic map $\mathcal{M}_k: \mathcal{R}^n \rightarrow \mathcal{R}^n$:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{u}_k = \mathcal{M}_k(\mathbf{x}).
\end{equation}
Then we project the transformed coordiantes onto a lower dimensional plane $\mathbf{u}_{k_\parallel} \in \mathbb{R}^m$.
\begin{equation}
    g(\mathbf{u}_{k_\parallel}) = \int{\rho \left( \mathcal{M}_k^{-1}(\mathbf{u}_k )\right) d\mathbf{u}_{k_\perp}}
\end{equation}

We can derive the form of the maximum-entropy distribution from a new functional. Here's some more text to fill out the line.

\begin{equation}
    \Psi [ 
        \rho(\mathbf{x}), 
        \rho_*(\mathbf{x}), 
        \{ g_k(\mathbf{u}_{k_\parallel}) \}
    ]
    =
    H[\rho(\mathbf{x}), \rho_*(\mathbf{x})]
    + 
    \sum_{k}^{} {
    \int
        \lambda_{k}(\mathbf{u}_{k_\parallel})
        \left(
            g_k(\mathbf{u}_{k_\parallel}) - 
            \int \rho \left( \mathcal{M}_k^{-1}(\mathbf{u}_k) \right) 
            d\mathbf{u}_{k_\perp}
        \right)
        d\mathbf{u}_{k_\parallel}
    }
\end{equation}
