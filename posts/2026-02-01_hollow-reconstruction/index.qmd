We injected ten minipulses in the SNS ring at fixed point in phase space, then extracted the beam and measured 36 wire-scanner profiles. I attempted to fit a four-dimensional distribution to the data.

You can see the donut shape in the $x$-$x'$ and $y$-$y'$ planes, which was discussed in [this post](../2026-01-30_eigenpainting-prl). The cross-plane projections definitely have uncertainty; this might be a good data set to use for UQ algorithm testing.
