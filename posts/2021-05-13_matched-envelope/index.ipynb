    "A beam of charged particles generates an electric field, which then exerts a force on each particle, whose motion modifies the electric field, and so on. This problem is familiar to plasma physics. One important feature of charged particle beams is that they are *non-neutral*, i.e., all particles have the same charge. Thus, all forces are long-range, making the problem difficult to handle analytically."

For certain values of the tune, nonlinear *magnetic* fields in the ring can drive single-particle resonances.^[I discuss this [here](https://austin-hoover.github.io/posts/2021-03-28_nonlinear_resonances/2021-03-28-nonlinear_resonances.html).] To avoid resonance conditions up to order $|M_x + M_y|$, the tunes $\\nu_{x, y}$ must be far from the lines defined by $M_x \\nu_x + M_y \\nu_y = N$, where $M_x$, $M_y$, and $N$ are integers. \n",

This wouldn't be a problem if the shift was the same for each particle, but a nonlinear space charge force causes the tune shift to depend on the particle's position, resulting in a *tune spread* that grows with the beam intensity. At high intensities, it becomes unavoidable that some particles cross dangerous low-order resonance lines. This is illustrated in Fig. 3."

First, space charge causes the final beam to depend on the initial beam in a potentially complicated way that is unknown before tracking the beam; this is especially true for long lattices and large beam intensities. This meant we would need to iterate to find the solution. Second, it was not immediately clear how to vary the distribution during the search; the full covariance matrix has ten unique elements, and they cannot be varied freely since the covariance matrix must remain positive-definite."

    "We can frame this as an optimization problem in which we search for the $\\mathbf{p}$ which minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the initial and final moments when tracking through one period. We utilized two different optimization methods. The first was SciPy's [nonlinear least squares](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.least_squares.html), which worked well in most cases. The second strategy was to track the beam over several periods and compute the period-by-period average of $\\mathbf{p}$, then use this average as the seed for the next round. This figure shows the method converging after a few iterations. The relevant code is found [here](https://github.com/austin-hoover/py-orbit/blob/master/py/orbit/envelope/danilov.py)."
