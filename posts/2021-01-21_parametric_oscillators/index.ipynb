For example, the oscillations of a pendulum (in the small angle approximation) on the surface of a planet whose gravitational pull varies periodically would be described by the above equation. The solution to this equation was derived by [George William Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_William_Hill) in 1886 to study lunar motion, and for this reason, it is known as Hill’s equation. It also finds application in areas such as condensed matter physics, quantum optics, and accelerator physics. After setting up the physical problem, we will examine the solutions and discuss their relevance to the last application, accelerator physics."

    "There are many physics issues associated with the optimization of these beam parameters. Accelerator physics is a field of applied physics that studies these issues. The task of the accelerator physicist is to understand, control, and measure the journey of the beam from its creation to its final destination. The difficulty of this task has grown over time; the improvement in accelerator performance has brought with it a staggering increase in size and complexity. The construction and operation of modern accelerators generally require years of planning, thousands of scientists and engineers, and hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. Despite this complexity, the underlying physics principles are quite simple, and the single particle motion in one of these machines can be understood analytically if a few approximations are made. In the end, we will arrive at Hill’s equation.\n",

Third, it must ensure the beam particles remain close together (focusing). It is helpful to use a coordinate system in which the s axis points along the design trajectory, and the x and y axes defined in the plane transverse to s. In this way, the motion is broken up into transverse and longitudinal dynamics."

In reality, there will always be higher order multipoles present in the field, but people work very hard to ensure these are much smaller than the desired multipole.
