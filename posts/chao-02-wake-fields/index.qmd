Following @chao_1993_physics, Chapter 2, *Wake Fields and Impedances*. 

* Calculate the electromagnetic wake fields generated by a relativistic beam in a vacuum chamber.
* Define the *wake function* and its Fourier transform, the *impedance*.


## Mode expansion of the charge and current distributions

We will use cylindrical coordiantes $r$, $\theta$, $s$, where $s$ is the axial coordinate. Consider a charge charge distribution $\rho(r, \theta, s)$ and current distribution $\mathbf{j}(r, \theta, s) of the form:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\rho(r, \theta, s) &= \sum_{m = 0}^{\infty} \rho_m(r, \theta, s) , \\
\mathbf{J}(r, \theta, s) &= \sum_{m = 0}^{\infty} \mathbf{J}_m(r, \theta, s) ,
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-label}

with the modes $\rho_m$ and $\mathbf{J}_m$ defined as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\rho_m(r, \theta, s) &= \frac{I_m}{\pi a^{m + 1} (1 + \delta_{m0}} \delta(s - ct) \delta(r - a) \cos(m\theta) , \\
\mathbf{J}_m(r, \theta, s) &= c \rho_m(r, \theta, s) \hat{s} ,
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-moments}

where $a$ is a radius, $\delta_{m0} = 1$ if $m = 0$ and $0$ otherwise, $I_m$ is the $m$th moment of the distribution, $c$ is the speed of light, and $t$ is time. @eq-moments describes a ring of radius $a$ with density proportional to $\cos(m\theta)$. The longitudinal density is a pancake, enforced by the $\delta(s - ct)$ term. 


## Wake functions

What is the force experienced by a particle trailing the beam? Assume the particle moves only along the $s$ axis. In the cylindrical coordinates, the Lorentz force $\mathbf{F} = q(\mathbf{E} + \hat{s} \times \mathbf{B}$ becomes

$$
\begin{aligned}
F_s      &= q E_s , \\
F_\theta &= q \left( E_\theta + B_r \right) , \\
F_r      &= q \left( E_r + B_\theta \right) .
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-field-components}

At high energies, we may assume the beam remains unchanged by the wake field and focus on the *integrated* force $\bar{\mathbf{F}}$,

$$
\bar{\mathbf{F}} = \int_{-L/2}^{+L/2} \mathbf{F} ds,
$$

where $L$ is some distance longer than the region of interest. The result is (2.49), which relates the averaged force to the averaged field. For an axially symmetric environment, (2.49) can be solved to yield:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\bar{F}_r      &= +q I_m W_m(z)_ m r^{m-1} \cos(m\theta) , \\
\bar{F}_\theta &= -q I_m W_m(z)_ m r^{m-1} \sin(m\theta) , \\
\bar{F}_s      &= -q I_m W'_m(z) r^m \cos(m\theta) , \\
\bar{B}_s      &= +q I_m W'_m(z) r^m \sin(m\theta) .
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-wake}

$W_m(z)$ is called the *wake function* and $W'_m(z)$ is the derivative of the wake function with respect to $s$. @eq-wake is valid for any axially symmetric boundary, but the wake function can only be determined once boundary conditions are applied. 

*Panofsky-Wenzel Theorem*. Define the transverse wake potential as $\bar{\mathbf{F}}_{\perp} = (\bar{F}_r, \bar{F}_\theta)$ and the longitudinal wake potential as $\bar{F}_{\parallel} = \bar{F}_s$. @eq-wake implies:

$$
\nabla_{\perp} \bar{F}_{\parallel} = \nabla_z \bar{\mathbf{F}}_{\perp} = \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \bar{\mathbf{F}}_{\perp} .
$$

Properties of wake functions:

1. The wake function is determined by the environment, not the beam.

1. $W'_m(z) = 0$ if $z > 0$. *(Wake fields always trail the beam.)*

1. $W'_m(0^-) \ge 0$. *(We expect a deccelerating field just behind the beam. It follows that a single particle experiences a longitudinal force but no transverse force from its own wake field.)*

1. $W'_m(0^-) \ge |W_m'(z)|$ for all $z$. *(Follows from the two-particle example; the system cannot gain energy.)*

Table 2.2 shows the wake potentials for $m = 0, 1, 2, 3$ in a Cartesian coordinate system.

The section ends with a discussion of wake field acceleration.
